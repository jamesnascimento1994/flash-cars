## Project Description

My app is called Flash Cars. It is a single player flash card game that quizzes you on your knowledge of car models and what brand they are a part of. For example, if the flashcard shows the car model name "Outback", you have to guess what the brand is. In this example, the brand would be "Subaru". There are 10 flashcards per game, and you can play as many games as you want. If you answer more than 5 wrong, you lose the game.

##### MVP Goals

- As a player, I want my game to recognize when I got an answer right or wrong.
- As a player, I would like to know if the card flips to show what the right answer is when I type in mine, so I can remember next time to correct myself if I get it wrong.
- As a player, I would like to be able to restart the game when I win or lose.
- As a player who requires assistive technologies, I would like accessibility features so that I'm not left out of enjoying the game.
- As a player, I would like to know how many cards I got right so I don't have to keep score.
- As a player, I would like to be informed with some indication when I answer a flash card so that I know my selection worked.

###### Stretch Goals

- As a player, I would like a victory animation when I win the game, so that I feel good about my victory!
- As a player, I would like a loud buzzing sound when I get an answer wrong.
- As a player, I would like a clip of Gene Wilder from "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory" saying "YOU GET NOTHING! YOU LOSE!" when I lose the game, because that would be really funny.
